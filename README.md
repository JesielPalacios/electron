## Quick start & Electron Fiddle

Use [`Electron Fiddle`](https://github.com/electron/fiddle)
to build, run, and package small Electron experiments, to see code examples for all of Electron's APIs, and
to try out different versions of Electron. It's designed to make the start of your journey with
Electron easier.

Alternatively, clone and run the
[electron/electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start)
repository to see a minimal Electron app in action:

```sh
# git clone https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start
git clone https://github.com/jesielpalacios/electron
cd electron-quick-start
npm install
npm start
```
